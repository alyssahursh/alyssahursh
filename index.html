	<h1>Hey, it's me — your friend Alyssa</h1>

	<p>I’m a proud alum of <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org" target="blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> and a software engineer at Amazon. I am <b>compulsively passionate</b> about “beginners” of all kinds, but particularly underrepresented, minority, and marginalized beginner software engineers.</p>

	<p>I believe that <b>anyone can learn to do anything.</b> If I know it, I will teach it. I employ Socratic questioning to teach critical thinking, and I live and breathe for the moment when a beginner says, “I figured it out all by myself!”</p> 

	<p>I believe that my purpose in life is to help others be the most capable versions of themselves that they can be.</p>

	<p>I write a lot about professional software development practices and I occasionally record videos. If you came here for my Ada-famous “doc collection,” my five-hour git tutorial, or my talk on Extreme Mentorship, you’re in the right place.</p>

	<p>I’m happy at Amazon and not looking for new opportunities right now. I am, however, <a href="http://date.alyssahursh.com" target="blank">available to date</a> 😉</p> 

	<p>This document was last updated on <b>20 MARCH 2021</b></p>

	<h2>The "doc collection"</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="docs/staying-focused-not-panicking.html" target="blank">Strategies for Staying Focused and Not Panicking</a> — Have you ever caught yourself "panic staring in the void" because you were overwhelmed by or afraid of your assigned task? You're not alone. Let's talk about how to get past that.</li>
		<li><a href="docs/asking-technical-questions.html" target="blank">Alyssa's Guide to Asking High-Quality Technical Questions</a> — The way you ask questions directly impacts the likelihood that you'll get the help you need. Learn how to ask really good questions.</li>
		<li><a href="docs/good-terminal.html" target="blank">Alyssa's Guide to a Good Terminal</a> — I'm a tooling minimalist because I like to keep my development set-up as close to a beginner's set-up as possible. Here are the five tools I can't live without.</li>
		<li><a href="docs/surviving-internship.html" target="blank">Alyssa's Guide to Surviving Internship</a> — Originally written for Ada interns at Amazon, this guide is about taking ownership over your internship to increase your chances of getting a full-time offer. </li>
		<li><a href="docs/what-the-path.html" target="blank">What the $PATH</a> — Getting the error <code>zsh: command not found</code>? This guide's for you.</li>
		<li><a href="docs/vim-crash-course.html" target="blank">Vim Crash Course</a> — You <i>have</i> to have a baseline level of comfort using vim. Take the 10 minute crash course. </li>
		<li><a href="docs/code-review-culture.html" target="blank">Code Review Culture</a> — Code review is personal. If you're an experienced engineer, the way you review code for and in front of junior engineers really matters. Here are the rules for code review on my team.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Videos</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="" target="blank">Your Friend Alyssa Teaches You Git</a> — When I was a beginner, my introduction to <code>git</code> was fear-based: "You're probably going to do something wrong and break everything," and "Linus Torvalds (the original author of git) never expected anyone to use git, so that's why it's so complicated." Neither of these things is true. Git is powerful, logical, and honestly pretty fun. There's almost nothing you can do in git that you can't undo. <b>Let me change your relationship with git</b></li>
		<li><a href="" target="blank">Extreme Mentorship</a> — People talk about the idea of a "10x engineer," where you somehow produce ten times as much work as your peers. The problem with this approach is that it stops the day you stop writing code. Learn how to teach two juniors engineers to be 2x engineers, then teach them each how to teach two more — a multi-level marketing scheme of mentorship. If you're <i>really</i> good at it, you can <b>be 10x engineer after you're dead</b></li>
	</ul>
